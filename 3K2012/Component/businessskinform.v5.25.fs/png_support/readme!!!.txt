How to install this TbsPNGImageList:

1. You must install PNGImage library from http://pngdelphi.sourceforge.net  
2. Add bspngimagelist.pas to the BSF package and recompile it.
3. Use TbsPNGImageList in all controls (see PngImages property), 
   because it inherited from standard TCustomImageList.
